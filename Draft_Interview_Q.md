#ETL & DataStage

>1. 1.	You are assigned to fix a Production incident.  Due to a defect in the ETL job released 6 months ago, some records in a time variant table are erroneous.   The table contains record sets of a million accounts  (one row for each attribute of an account).  For each accounts, only some attributes are active and some are closed.  However, in this table, either all attributes of an account are active or they are all closed.  For incident fixes, developers need to do both trouble shooting and fix.
